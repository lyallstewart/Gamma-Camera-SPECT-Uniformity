# Gamma Camera SPECT Uniformity
Gamma cameras are imaging tools used in hospitals to view physiological processes by imaging the gamma radiation emitted by radio-pharmaceuticals. As a part of quality control measures to ensure the functionality of gamma cameras, uniformity tests need to be completed to determine whether the devices are functioning correctly. These involve imaging a uniform cylinder body of radiation, also called a test phantom, and checking that the [DICOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOM) images produced by a gamma camera show a similarly uniform image. 

Traditionally, medical professionals have inspected DICOM images and measured the uniformity across limited parts of the image. This project - conducted as part of a 5 student group and kindly set by the Royal Devon & Exeter Hospital - has aimed to create a piece of software as a proof of concept that allows uniformity to be calculated across an entire DICOM image at once, which has the potential to increase the efficiency and reliability of quality control tests for gamma cameras.
